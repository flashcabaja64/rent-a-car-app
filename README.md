# Rent-a-car App!
## Description
#### Objective
The objective is to build a car sharing native application with the minimum requirements below. There are many optimizations and code refactoring changes that did not get fully considered due to the time constraints.
#### Requirements
 -   Use fake car data (car details & images) to populate the UI
    -   See the resources section on APIs for random car data & images
    -   Assume the "price" property on the fake car data represents the daily rental rate ($/day)
 -   Simple text matching for the text search feature is sufficient
 -   Filters must be fully functional
    -   At a minimum, the user must be able to filter by car make, year, and color
    -   Feel free to add range sliders for the filters (not required, but extra points)
 -   Amazing UI/UX
 - Intuitive - is it easy to use?
 - Comprehensive - does the UI draw users' attention to particular focus areas?
 - Design - does it look nice?
#### Main Tech Stacks
 - react-dom
 - react-native
 - typescript
 - react-redux
 - react-native-paper
 - @react-navigation/native
 - @expo/cli

# Summary

The "Accounts" and "Favorites" tab was added for the potentiality of the final product. Those two tabs are not functional nor does it contain any content.
